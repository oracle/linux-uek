/**
 * cvmx_spx#_clk_ctl
 *
 * Notes:
 * * SRXDLCK
 *   When asserted, this bit locks the Spi4 receive DLLs.  This bit also
 *   acts as the Spi4 receiver reset and must be asserted before the
 *   training sequences are used to initialize the interface.  This bit
 *   only applies to the receiver interface.
 *
 * * RCVTRN
 *   Once the SRXDLCK bit is asserted and the DLLs have locked and the
 *   system has been programmed, software should assert this bit in order
 *   to start looking for valid training sequence and synchronize the
 *   interface. This bit only applies to the receiver interface.
 *
 * * DRPTRN
 *   The Spi4 receiver can either convert training packets into NOPs or
 *   drop them entirely.  Dropping ticks allows the interface to deskew
 *   periodically if the dclk and eclk ratios are close. This bit only
 *   applies to the receiver interface.
 *
 * * SNDTRN
 *   When software sets this bit, it indicates that the Spi4 transmit
 *   interface has been setup and has seen the calendare status.  Once the
 *   transmitter begins sending training data, the receiving device is free
 *   to start traversing the calendar table to synch the link.
 *
 * * STATRCV
 *   This bit determines which status clock edge to sample the status
 *   channel in Spi4 mode.  Since the status channel is in the opposite
 *   direction to the datapath, the STATRCV actually effects the
 *   transmitter/TX block.
 *
 * * STATDRV
 *   This bit determines which status clock edge to drive the status
 *   channel in Spi4 mode.  Since the status channel is in the opposite
 *   direction to the datapath, the STATDRV actually effects the
 *   receiver/RX block.
 *
 * * RUNBIST
 *   RUNBIST will beginning BIST/BISR in all the SPX compilied memories.
 *   These memories are...
 *
 *       * spx.srx.spi4.dat.dpr        // FIFO Spi4 to IMX
 *       * spx.stx.cal.calendar        // Spi4 TX calendar table
 *       * spx.srx.spi4.cal.calendar   // Spi4 RX calendar table
 *
 *   RUNBIST must never be asserted when the interface is enabled.
 *   Furthmore, setting RUNBIST at any other time is destructive and can
 *   cause data and configuration corruption.  The entire interface must be
 *   reconfigured when this bit is set.
 *
 * * CLKDLY
 *   CLKDLY should be kept at its reset value during normal operation.  This
 *   register controls the SPI4.2 static clock positioning which normally only is
 *   set to the non-reset value in quarter clocking schemes.  In this mode, the
 *   delay window is not large enough for slow clock freq, therefore clock and
 *   data must be statically positioned with CSRs.  By changing the clock position
 *   relative to the data bits, we give the system a wider window.
 *
 * * SEETRN
 *   In systems in which no training data is sent to N2 or N2 cannot
 *   correctly sample the training data, software may pulse this bit by
 *   writing a '1' followed by a '0' in order to correctly set the
 *   receivers state.  The receive data bus should be idle at this time
 *   (only NOPs on the bus).  If N2 cannot see at least on training
 *   sequence, the data bus will not send any data to the core.  The
 *   interface will hang.

/**
 * cvmx_spx#_dbg_deskew_ctl
 *
 * Notes:
 * These bits are meant as a backdoor to control Spi4 per-bit deskew.  See
 * that Spec for more details.
 *
 *   The basic idea is to allow software to disable the auto-deskew widgets
 *   and make any adjustments by hand.  These steps should only be taken
 *   once the RCVTRN bit is set and before any real traffic is sent on the
 *   Spi4 bus.  Great care should be taken when messing with these bits as
 *   improper programmings can cause catestrophic or intermitent problems.
 *
 *   The params we have to test are the MUX tap selects and the XCV delay
 *   tap selects.
 *
 *   For the muxes, we can set each tap to a random value and then read
 *   back the taps.  To write...
 *
 *    SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[BITSEL]   = bit to set
 *    SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[OFFSET]   = mux tap value (2-bits)
 *    SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[MUX]      = go bit
 *
 *   Notice this can all happen with a single CSR write.  To read, first
 *   set the bit you to look at with the SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[BITSEL], then
 *   simply read SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_STATE[MUXSEL]...
 *
 *    SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[BITSEL]   = bit to set
 *    SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_STATE[MUXSEL] = 2-bit value
 *
 *   For the xcv delay taps, the CSR controls increment and decrement the
 *   5-bit count value in the XCV.  This is a saturating counter, so it
 *   will not wrap when decrementing below zero or incrementing above 31.
 *
 *   To write...
 *
 *    SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[BITSEL]   = bit to set
 *    SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[OFFSET]   = tap value increment or decrement amount (5-bits)
 *    SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[INC|DEC]  = go bit
 *
 *   These values are copied in SPX, so that they can be read back by
 *   software by a similar mechanism to the MUX selects...
 *
 *    SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[BITSEL]   = bit to set
 *    SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_STATE[OFFSET] = 5-bit value
 *
 *   In addition, there is a reset bit that sets all the state back to the
 *   default/starting value of 0x10.
 *
 *    SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[CLRDLY]   = 1
 *
 * SINGLE STEP TRAINING MODE (WILMA)
 *     Debug feature that will enable the user to single-step the debug
 *     logic to watch initial movement and trends by putting the training
 *     machine in single step mode.
 *
 * * SPX*_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[SSTEP]
 *        This will put the training control logic into single step mode.  We
 *        will not deskew in this scenario and will require the TX device to
 *        send continuous training sequences.
 *
 *        It is required that SRX*_COM_CTL[INF_EN] be clear so that suspect
 *        data does not flow into the chip.
 *
 *        Deasserting SPX*_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[SSTEP] will attempt to deskew as per
 *        the normal definition.  Single step mode is for debug only.  Special
 *        care must be given to correctly deskew the interface if normal
 *        operation is desired.
 *
 * * SPX*_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[SSTEP_GO]
 *        Each write of '1' to SSTEP_GO will go through a single training
 *        iteration and will perform...
 *
 *        - DLL update, if SPX*_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[DLLDIS] is clear
 *        - coarse update, if SPX*_TRN4_CTL[MUX_EN] is set
 *        - single fine update, if SPX*_TRN4_CTL[MACRO_EN] is set and an edge
 *       was detected after walked +/- SPX*_TRN4_CTL[MAXDIST] taps.
 *
 *        Writes to this register have no effect if the interface is not in
 *        SSTEP mode (SPX*_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[SSTEP]).
 *
 *        The WILMA mode will be cleared at the final state transition, so
 *        that software can set SPX*_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[SSTEP] and
 *        SPX*_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[SSTEP_GO] before setting SPX*_CLK_CTL[RCVTRN]
 *        and the machine will go through the initial iteration and stop -
 *        waiting for another SPX*_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[SSTEP_GO] or an interface
 *        enable.
 *
 * * SPX*_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[FALL8]
 *   Determines how many pattern matches are required during training
 *   operations to fallout of training and begin processing the normal data
 *   stream.  The default value is 10 pattern matches.  The pattern that is
 *   used is dependent on the SPX*_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[FALLNOP] CSR which
 *   determines between non-training packets (the default) and NOPs.
 *
 * * SPX*_DBG_DESKEW_CTL[FALLNOP]
 *   Determines the pattern that is required during training operations to
 *   fallout of training and begin processing the normal data stream.  The
 *   default value is to match against non-training data.  Setting this
 *   bit, changes the behavior to watch for NOPs packet instead.
 *
 *   This bit should not be changed dynamically while the link is
 *   operational.

/**
 * cvmx_spx#_int_reg
 *
 * SPX_INT_REG - Interrupt Register
 *
 *
 * Notes:
 * * PRTNXA
 *   This error indicates that the port on the Spi bus was not a valid port
 *   for the system.  Spi4 accesses occur on payload control bit-times. The
 *   SRX can be configured with the exact number of ports available (by
 *   SRX_COM_CTL[PRTS] register).  Any Spi access to anthing outside the range
 *   of 0 .. (SRX_COM_CTL[PRTS] - 1) is considered an error.  The offending
 *   port is logged in SPX_INT_DAT[PRT] if there are no pending interrupts in
 *   SPX_INT_REG that require SPX_INT_DAT[PRT].
 *
 *   SRX will not drop the packet with the bogus port address.  Instead, the
 *   port will be mapped into the supported port range.  The remapped address
 *   in simply...
 *
 *            Address = [ interfaceId, ADR[3:0] ]
 *
 *   If the SPX detects that a PRTNXA error has occured, the packet will
 *   have its ERR bit set (or'ed in with the ERR bit from the transmitter)
 *   if the SPX_ERR_CTL[PRTNXA] bit is clear.
 *
 *   In Spi4 mode, SPX will generate an interrupt for every 8B data burst
 *   associated with the invalid address.  The SPX_INT_DAT[MUL] bit will never
 *   be set.
 *
 * * ABNORM
 *   This bit simply indicates that a given packet had abnormal terminiation.
 *   In Spi4 mode, this means that packet completed with an EOPS[1:0] code of
 *   2'b01.  This error can also be thought of as the application specific
 *   error (as mentioned in the Spi4 spec).  The offending port is logged in
 *   SPX_INT_DAT[PRT] if there are no pending interrupts in SPX_INT_REG that
 *   require SPX_INT_DAT[PRT].
 *
 *   The ABNORM error is only raised when the ERR bit that comes from the
 *   Spi interface is set.  It will never assert if any internal condition
 *   causes the ERR bit to assert (e.g. PRTNXA or DPERR).
 *
 * * SPIOVR
 *   This error indicates that the FIFOs that manage the async crossing from
 *   the Spi clocks to the core clock domains have overflowed.  This is a
 *   fatal error and can cause much data/control corruption since ticks will
 *   be dropped and reordered.  This is purely a function of clock ratios and
 *   correct system ratios should make this an impossible condition.
 *
 * * CLSERR
 *   This is a Spi4 error that indicates that a given data transfer burst
 *   that did not terminate with an EOP, did not end with the 16B alignment
 *   as per the Spi4 spec.  The offending port cannot be logged since the
 *   block does not know the streamm terminated until the port switches.
 *   At that time, that packet has already been pushed down the pipe.
 *
 *   The CLSERR bit does not actually check the Spi4 burst - just how data
 *   is accumulated for the downstream logic.  Bursts that are separted by
 *   idles or training will still be merged into accumulated transfers and
 *   will not fire the CLSERR condition.  The checker is really checking
 *   non-8B aligned, non-EOP data ticks that are sent downstream.  These
 *   ticks are what will really mess up the core.
 *
 *   This is an expensive fix, so we'll probably let it ride.  We never
 *   claim to check Spi4 protocol anyway.
 *
 * * DRWNNG
 *   This error indicates that the Spi4 FIFO that services the GMX has
 *   overflowed.  Like the SPIOVR error condition, correct system ratios
 *   should make this an impossible condition.
 *
 * * RSVERR
 *   This Spi4 error indicates that the Spi4 receiver has seen a reserve
 *   control packet.  A reserve control packet is an invalid combiniation
 *   of bits on DAT[15:12].  Basically this is DAT[15] == 1'b0 and DAT[12]
 *   == 1'b1 (an SOP without a payload command).  The RSVERR indicates an
 *   error has occured and SPX_INT_DAT[RSVOP] holds the first reserved
 *   opcode and will be set if there are no pending interrupts in
 *   SPX_INT_REG that require SPX_INT_DAT[RSVOP].
 *
 * * TPAOVR
 *   This bit indicates that the TPA Watcher has flagged an event.  See the
 *   TPA Watcher for a more detailed discussion.
 *
 * * DIPERR
 *   This bit indicates that the Spi4 receiver has encountered a DIP4
 *   miscompare on the datapath.  A DIPERR can occur in an IDLE or a
 *   control word that frames a data burst.  If the DIPERR occurs on a
 *   framing word there are three cases.
 *
 *   1) DIPERR occurs at the end of a data burst.  The previous packet is
 *      marked with the ERR bit to be processed later if
 *      SPX_ERR_CTL[DIPCLS] is clear.
 *   2) DIPERR occurs on a payload word.  The subsequent packet is marked
 *      with the ERR bit to be processed later if SPX_ERR_CTL[DIPPAY] is
 *      clear.
 *   3) DIPERR occurs on a control word that closes on packet and is a
 *      payload for another packet.  In this case, both packets will have
 *      their ERR bit marked depending on the respective values of
 *      SPX_ERR_CTL[DIPCLS] and SPX_ERR_CTL[DIPPAY] as discussed above.
 *
 * * SYNCERR
 *   This bit indicates that the Spi4 receiver has encountered
 *   SPX_ERR_CTL[ERRCNT] consecutive Spi4 DIP4 errors and the interface
 *   should be synched.
 *
 * * CALERR
 *   This bit indicates that the Spi4 calendar table encountered a parity
 *   error.  This error bit is associated with the calendar table on the RX
 *   interface - the interface that receives the Spi databus.  Parity errors
 *   can occur during normal operation when the calendar table is constantly
 *   being read for the port information, or during initialization time, when
 *   the user has access.  Since the calendar table is split into two banks,
 *   SPX_INT_DAT[CALBNK] indicates which banks have taken a parity error.
 *   CALBNK[1] indicates the error occured in the upper bank, while CALBNK[0]
 *   indicates that the error occured in the lower bank.  SPX_INT_DAT[CALBNK]
 *   will be set if there are no pending interrupts in SPX_INT_REG that
 *   require SPX_INT_DAT[CALBNK].
 *
 * * SPF
 *   This bit indicates that a Spi fatal error has occurred.  A fatal error
 *   is defined as any error condition for which the corresponding
 *   SPX_INT_SYNC bit is set.  Therefore, conservative systems can halt the
 *   interface on any error condition although this is not strictly
 *   necessary.  Some error are much more fatal in nature than others.
 *
 *   PRTNXA, SPIOVR, CLSERR, DRWNNG, DIPERR, CALERR, and SYNCERR are examples
 *   of fatal error for different reasons - usually because multiple port
 *   streams could be effected.  ABNORM, RSVERR, and TPAOVR are conditions
 *   that are contained to a single packet which allows the interface to drop
 *   a single packet and remain up and stable.

/**
 * cvmx_spx#_trn4_ctl
 *
 * Notes:
 * These bits are controls for the Spi4 RX bit deskew logic.  See that Spec
 * for further details.
 *
 * * BOOT_BIT
 *   On the initial training synchronization sequence, the hardware has the
 *   BOOT_BIT set which means that it will continueously perform macro
 *   operations.  Once the BOOT_BIT is cleared, the macro machine will finish
 *   the macro operation is working on and then return to the idle state.
 *   Subsequent training sequences will only go through a single macro
 *   operation in order to do slight deskews.
 *
 * * JITTER
 *   Minimum value is 1.  This parameter must be set for Spi4 mode using
 *   auto-bit deskew.  Regardless of the original intent, this field must be
 *   set non-zero for deskew to function correctly.
 *
 *   The thought is the JITTER range is no longer required since the macro
 *   machine was enhanced to understand about edge direction.  Originally
 *   these bits were intended to compensate for clock jitter.
 *
 *   dly:    this is the intrinsic delay of each delay element
 *              tap currently, it is 70ps-110ps.
 *   jitter: amount of jitter we expect in the system (~200ps)
 *   j:      number of taps to account for jitter
 *
 *   j = ((jitter / dly) + 1)
 *
 * * TRNTEST
 *   This mode is used to test systems to make sure that the bit deskew
 *   parameters have been correctly setup.  After configuration, software can
 *   set the TRNTEST mode bit.  This should be done before SRX_COM_CTL[ST_EN]
 *   is set such that we can be sure that the TX device is simply sending
 *   continuous training patterns.
 *
 *   The test mode samples every incoming bit-time and makes sure that it is
 *   either a training control or a training data packet.  If any other data
 *   is observed, then SPX_DBG_DESKEW_STATE[TESTRES] will assert signaling a
 *   test failure.
 *
 *   Software must clear TRNTEST before training is terminated.
 *
 * * Example Spi4 RX init flow...
 *
 * 1) set the CLKDLY lines (SPXX_CLK_CTL[CLKDLY])
 *    - these bits must be set before the DLL can successfully lock
 *
 * 2) set the SRXDLCK (SPXX_CLK_CTL[SRXDLCK])
 *    - this is the DLL lock bit which also acts as a block reset
 *
 * 3) wait for the DLLs lock
 *
 * 4) set any desired fields in SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_CTL
 *    - This register has only one field that most users will care about.
 *      When set, DLLDIS will disable sending update pulses to the Spi4 RX
 *      DLLs.  This pulse allows the DLL to adjust to clock variations over
 *      time.  In general, it is desired behavior.
 *
 * 5) set fields in SPXX_TRN4_CTL
 *    - These fields deal with the MUX training sequence
 *      * MUX_EN
 *        This is the enable bit for the mux select.  The MUX select will
 *        run in the training sequence between the DLL and the Macro
 *        sequence when enabled.  Once the MUX selects are selected, the
 *        entire macro sequence must be rerun.  The expectation is that
 *        this is only run at boot time and this is bit cleared at/around
 *        step \#8.
 *    - These fields deal with the Macro training sequence
 *      * MACRO_EN
 *        This is the enable bit for the macro sequence.  Macro sequences
 *        will run after the DLL and MUX training sequences.  Each macro
 *        sequence can move the offset by one value.
 *      * MAXDIST
 *        This is how far we will search for an edge.  Example...
 *
 *           dly:    this is the intrinsic delay of each delay element
 *                   tap currently, it is 70ps-110ps.
 *           U:      bit time period in time units.
 *
 *           MAXDIST = MIN(16, ((bit_time / 2) / dly)
 *
 *           Each MAXDIST iteration consists of an edge detect in the early
 *           and late (+/-) directions in an attempt to center the data.  This
 *           requires two training transistions, the control/data and
 *           data/control transistions which comprise a training sequence.
 *           Therefore, the number of training sequences required for a single
 *           macro operation is simply MAXDIST.
 *
 * 6) set the RCVTRN go bit (SPXX_CLK_CTL[RCVTRN])
 *    - this bit synchs on the first valid complete training cycle and
 *      starts to process the training packets
 *
 * 6b) This is where software could manually set the controls as opposed to
 *     letting the hardware do it.  See the SPXX_DBG_DESKEW_CTL register
 *        description for more detail.
 *
 * 7) the TX device must continue to send training packets for the initial
 *    time period.
 *    - this can be determined by...
 *
 *      DLL: one training sequence for the DLL adjustment (regardless of enable/disable)
 *      MUX: one training sequence for the Flop MUX taps (regardless of enable/disable)
 *      INIT_SEQUENCES: max number of taps that we must move
 *
 *         INIT_SEQUENCES = MIN(16, ((bit_time / 2) / dly))
 *
 *         INIT_TRN = DLL + MUX + ROUNDUP((INIT_SEQUENCES * (MAXDIST + 2)))
 *
 *
 *    - software can either wait a fixed amount of time based on the clock
 *      frequencies or poll the SPXX_CLK_STAT[SRXTRN] register.  Each
 *      assertion of SRXTRN means that at least one training sequence has
 *      been received.  Software can poll, clear, and repeat on this bit to
 *      eventually count all required transistions.
 *
 *      int cnt = 0;
 *      while (cnt < INIT_TRN) [
 *             if (SPXX_CLK_STAT[SRXTRN]) [
 *                cnt++;
 *                SPXX_CLK_STAT[SRXTRN] = 0;
 *             ]
 *      ]
 *
 *   - subsequent training sequences will normally move the taps only
 *     one position, so the ALPHA equation becomes...
 *
 *     MAC   = (MAXDIST == 0) ? 1 : ROUNDUP((1 * (MAXDIST + 2))) + 1
 *
 *        ALPHA = DLL + MUX + MAC
 *
 *     ergo, MAXDIST simplifies to...
 *
 *        ALPHA = (MAXDIST == 0) ? 3 : MAXDIST + 5
 *
 *        DLL and MUX and MAC will always require at least a training sequence
 *        each - even if disabled.  If the macro sequence is enabled, an
 *        additional training sequenece at the end is necessary.  The extra
 *        sequence allows for all training state to be cleared before resuming
 *        normal operation.
 *
 * 8) after the recevier gets enough training sequences in order to achieve
 *    deskew lock, set SPXX_TRN4_CTL[CLR_BOOT]
 *    - this disables the continuous macro sequences and puts into into one
 *      macro sequnence per training operation
 *    - optionally, the machine can choose to fall out of training if
 *      enough NOPs follow the training operation (require at least 32 NOPs
 *      to follow the training sequence).
 *
 *    There must be at least MAXDIST + 3 training sequences after the
 *    SPXX_TRN4_CTL[CLR_BOOT] is set or sufficient NOPs from the TX device.
 *
 * 9) the TX device continues to send training sequences until the RX
 *    device sends a calendar transistion.  This is controlled by
 *    SRXX_COM_CTL[ST_EN].  Other restrictions require other Spi parameters
 *    (e.g. the calendar table) to be setup before this bit can be enabled.
 *    Once the entire interface is properly programmed, software writes
 *    SRXX_COM_CTL[INF_EN].  At this point, the Spi4 packets will begin to
 *    be sent into the N2K core and processed by the chip.
