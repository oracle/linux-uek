config CAVIUM_OCTEON_EXTRA_CVMSEG
	int "Number of extra L1 cache lines reserved for CVMSEG memory"
	range 0 50
	default 0
	help
	  CVMSEG LM is a segment that accesses portions of the dcache
	  as a local memory; the larger CVMSEG is, the smaller the
	  cache is.  The kernel uses two or three blocks (one for TLB
	  exception handlers, one for driver IOBDMA operations, and on
	  models that need it, one for LMTDMA operations). This
	  selects an optional extra number of CVMSEG lines for use by
	  other software.

	  Normally no extra lines are required, and this parameter
	  should be set to zero.

config FAST_ACCESS_TO_THREAD_POINTER
	bool "Enable fast access to the thread pointer"
	default "y"
	help
	  For Mips, normally the TLS thread pointer is accessed by the
	  userspace program executing a "rdhwr" from register $29. This
	  register doesn't exist, so the kernel emulates the instruction
	  assigning the thread pointer to the value register. This option
	  supplies an alternate, faster access to the thread pointer. A
	  side effect of this option is that the highest 8 bytes of CVMSEG
	  is used by the kernel to save and restore the thread pointer during
	  the TLB fault handlers. This CVMSEG address isn't available to user
	  applications.
