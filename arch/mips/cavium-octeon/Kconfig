	bool "Build the kernel to be used only on OCTEON II or OCTEON III processor cores"
	default "n"
	help
	  This option enables the generation of Octeon2 specific
	  instructions by the compiler, resulting in a kernel that is
	  more efficient, but that will not run on Octeon and
	  OcteonPlus processor cores.

	help
	  The CN6XXX chips requires build time workarounds to
	  function reliably, select this option to enable them.  These
	  workarounds will cause a slight decrease in performance on
	  non-CN6XXX hardware.

	default 2
	help
	  CVMSEG LM is a segment that accesses portions of the dcache as a
	  local memory; the larger CVMSEG is, the smaller the cache is.
	  This selects the size of CVMSEG LM, which is in cache blocks. The
	  legally range is from 2 to 54 cache blocks (i.e. CVMSEG LM is
	  between zero and 6192 bytes).

config FAST_ACCESS_TO_THREAD_POINTER
	bool "Enable fast access to the thread pointer"
	default "y"
	help
	  For Mips, normally the TLS thread pointer is accessed by the
	  userspace program executing a "rdhwr" from register $29. This
	  register doesn't exist, so the kernel emulates the instruction
	  assigning the thread pointer to the value register. This option
	  supplies an alternate, faster access to the thread pointer. A
	  side effect of this option is that the highest 8 bytes of CVMSEG
	  is used by the kernel to save and restore the thread pointer during
	  the TLB fault handlers. This CVMSEG address isn't available to user
	  applications.

	  Allows user applications to directly access the Octeon hardware
