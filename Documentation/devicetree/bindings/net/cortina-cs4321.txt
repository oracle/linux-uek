Cortina CS4321 dual RXAIU/quad XAUI 10G Ethernet PHYs.  Each PHY
within the package is mostly independent and has the following
properties.  These phys do *not* implement the standard IEEE 802.3
clause 45 registers.

Required Properties:

- compatible : "cortina,cs4321" or "cortina,cs4318".
- reg : The address on the system management bus (MDIO/I2C/SPI address)
- cortina,host-mode : Either "rxaui" or "xaui", the protocol used to
  communicate with the Ethernet MAC.

Optional Properties:

- interrupts : One set of cells (per the interrupt-parent) for the
  interrupt line.
- interrupt-parent : Standard interrupt-parent property for the interrupt.

Example:

	phy0: ethernet-phy@4 {
		reg = <0x04>;
		compatible = "cortina,cs4318";
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
		interrupts = <11 8>; /* Pin 11, active low */
		cortina,host-mode = "rxaui";
	};
