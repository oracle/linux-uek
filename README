UEK: Oracle's Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel
============================================

The Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) is a Linux kernel built by Oracle and
supported via Oracle Linux support. Its focus is performance, stability, and
minimal backports by tracking the mainline source code as closely as is
practical. UEK is well-tested and used to run Oracle's Engineered Systems,
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and large enterprise deployments for
Oracle customers.
