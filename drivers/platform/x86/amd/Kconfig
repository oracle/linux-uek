	help
	  WBRF(Wifi Band RFI mitigation) mechanism allows Wifi drivers
	  to notify the frequencies they are using so that other hardware
	  can be reconfigured to avoid harmonic conflicts.

	  AMD provides an ACPI based mechanism to support WBRF on platform with
	  appropriate underlying support.

	  This mechanism will only be activated on platforms that advertise a
	  need for it.
