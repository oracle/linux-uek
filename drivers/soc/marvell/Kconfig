config OCTEONTX2_RM
	tristate "OcteonTX2 RVU Resource Manager driver"
	depends on OCTEONTX2_AF
	help
	  This driver offers resource management interfaces for Marvell's
	  OcteonTX2 Resource Virtualization Unit SSO/TIM PFs which are used
	  for interfacing with non-NIC hardware offload units.

config OCTEONTX2_RM_DOM_SYSFS
	bool "OcteonTX2 RVU Resource Manager domain sysfs"
	depends on OCTEONTX2_RM
	help
	  Enable Application Domain sysfs which simplifies management of
	  SSO/TIM VFs and OcteonTX2 RVU based NIC devices by the system
	  administrator. This interface consists of the following files:

	  I. /sys/bus/pci/drivers/octeontx2-rm/0*/create_domain

	  Writing to this file will:
	  1. Create a domain directory in /sys/bus/pci/drivers/octeontx2-rm/0*
	     with the domain name
	  2. Reserve one of SSO/TIM VFs for this domain and set its limits
	     according to the specification passed in write string
	  3. Create symlinks to all devices that will be part of the domain
	     in the directory created in point 1
	  4. Create domain_id file returning the ID assigned to this domain
	     (effectively the domain name)
	  5. Create domain_in_use file which reports state of domain's
	     SSO/TIM device's in_use file to indicate when domain is used
	     by an application.

	  The syntax for writing into this file is:

	      name;param:val(;param:val)*

	  * name - domain name
	  * param - parameter name, based on the parameter, its value 'val'
	    has to have a different format:
	    * sso, ssow, npa, tim, cpt - 'val' is an integer value of the
	      number of LFs to assign to the domain
	    * port - 'val' is in 'DDDD:BB:DD.F' format and specifies device
	      representing a port.

	  There are the following rules when creating a domain:

	  1. Domain names must be unique
	  2. Each domain must have at least 1 NPA and 1 SSOW LF
	  3. One port may be only assigned to a single domain

	  II. /sys/bus/pci/drivers/octeontx2-rm/0*/destroy_domain

	  Writing domain name to this file will cause given domain to be
	  removed from the sysfs. This includes:
	  1. Setting all limits of domain's SSO/TIM device to 0
	  2. Removing all sysfs structures for this domain
	  3. Removing all ports in this application domain from the list of
	     ports in use.

	  Removal of the domain is disabled while domain is in use, that
	  is while the 'in_use' flag of the domain's SSO/TIM device is set.
	  User/admin may query the status of this flag using the
	  'domain_in_use'  file in the domain's sysfs directory.
