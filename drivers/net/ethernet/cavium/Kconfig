	select THUNDER_NIC_BGX
	help
	  This driver supports Thunder's NIC physical function.
	  The NIC provides the controller and DMA engines to
	  move network traffic to/from the memory. The NIC
	  works closely with TNS, BGX and SerDes to implement the
	  functions replacing and virtualizing those of a typical
	  standalone PCIe NIC chip.

	depends on PTP_1588_CLOCK
	help
	  This driver adds support for the Precision Time Protocol Clocks and
	  Timestamping coprocessor (PTP) found on Cavium processors.
	  PTP provides timestamping mechanism that is suitable for use in IEEE 1588
	  Precision Time Protocol or other purposes.  Timestamps can be used in
	  BGX, TNS, GTI, and NIC blocks.

	  This driver supports Cavium LiquidIO Intelligent Server Adapters
	  based on CN66XX, CN68XX and CN23XX chips.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called liquidio.  This is recommended.

	help
	  This option enables a very simple ethernet driver for internal core
	  to core traffic. It relies on another driver, octeon-ethernet,
	  to perform all hardware setup. This driver's purpose is to supply
	  basic networking between different Linux images running on the same
	  chip. A single core loads the octeon-ethernet module, all other cores
	  load this driver. On load, the driver waits for some other core to
	  perform hardware setup.
