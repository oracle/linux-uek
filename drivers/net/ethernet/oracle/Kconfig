config NET_VENDOR_ORACLE
	bool "Oracle devices"
	default y
	depends on PCI || PCI_MSI
	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y
	  and read the Ethernet-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Intel cards. If you say Y, you will be asked for
	  your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_ORACLE
config SXGE 
        tristate "SXGE SOL ethernet driver "
        depends on PCI
        ---help---
          This driver supports the SXGE SOL 40Gb Ethernet driver.  

config SXGEVF 
        tristate "SXGEVF SOL ethernet driver "
        depends on PCI
        ---help---
          This driver supports the SXGEVF SOL 40Gb Ethernet driver.
