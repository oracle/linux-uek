	  fwctl provides a userspace API for restricted access to communicate
	  with on-device firmware. The communication channel is intended to
	  support a wide range of lockdown compatible device behaviors including
	  manipulating device FLASH, debugging, and other activities that don't
	  fit neatly into an existing subsystem.
