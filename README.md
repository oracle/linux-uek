UEK-next: Oracle's Next Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Development Release
=========================================================================

The Next Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Developer Release (UEK-next) is the
next generation of the UEK kernel based upon the upstream Linux `v6.12` tag.

The UEK-next developer release allows Oracle Linux users to try out the latest
developments from upstream Linux combined with Oracle UEK-specific features.

The original README for the Linux kernel along with a other useful documentation
can be found at Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

## Support

UEK-next is not supported for production use, however we will provide limited
test and development support for these kernels to help validate applications and
workloads.

## How it is formed

The UEK-next release is built by applying UEK specific fixes on top of the
latest Linux mainline release tag.

UEK-next developer releases are upstream Linux kernels with Oracle Linux patches
for use to evaluate new features in upstream Linux and enable developers to
experiment with the latest hardware support, and to validate application
compatibility with the latest kernels.

Every UEK-next release is based on a major upstream release (e.g.: 6.10 based,
6.12 based, etc.)

## Noteworthy Changes

- Continued to bring in the upstream extensible scheduler class "sched_ext"

  This new scheduler provides a means to write additional CPU schedulers using
  BPF, meaning that it can be introduced or updated on a live system. The
  upstream changes were brought in to enable developers using UEK to try it
  out.

  The changes used for UEK-next v6.12 were based on those targeting v6.12 at:

  - https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tj/sched_ext.git/tag/?h=sched_ext-for-6.12-rc1-fixes

- Updated package naming

  To make it easier to identify a UEK-next kernel we have updated the RPM and
  the effective `uname -r` output to use the OS release of `ol9ueknext`, for
  example: 

  ```
  $ uname -r
  6.12.0-4.el9ueknext.x86_64
  ```

  Similarly, the RPM name now includes this too:

  ```
  kernel-ueknext-6.12.0-4.el9ueknext.x86_64.rpm
  kernel-ueknext-core-6.12.0-4.el9ueknext.x86_64.rpm
  kernel-ueknext-modules-6.12.0-4.el9ueknext.x86_64.rpm
  kernel-ueknext-modules-core-6.12.0-4.el9ueknext.x86_64.rpm
  kernel-ueknext-modules-extra-6.12.0-4.el9ueknext.x86_64.rpm
  ```

- Introduction of the upstream extensible scheduler class "sched_ext"

  This new scheduler provides a means to write additional CPU schedulers using
  BPF, meaning that it can be introduced or updated on a live system. It is not
  on by default, but requires the writing of a BPF custom scheduler. The
  upstream changes were brought in to enable developers using UEK to try it
  out.

- Set UEK-next as default kernel post-install

  Because UEK-next is not a production kernel, it was decided not autoselect it as the
  default kernel on installation. Should you prefer it to be the default kernel, you
  may do so by either:

  - Prior to installation, if not already done, setting the default
    kernel in `/etc/sysconfig/kernel` using the line:

    ```
	DEFAULTKERNEL=kernel-ueknext-core
	```

  - Post installation, set it as the default using `grubby` as:

    ```
	sudo grubby --set-default=/boot/vmlinuz-6.12.0-4.el9ueknext.$(name -p)
	```

## Known Problems

- Some NVME devices exhibit what appears to be a corruption of the metadata

  Due to inconsistencies between the firmware and the kernel, the kernel
  believes that the device supports WRITE ZEROES, when it does not.

  This can be resolved by ensuring that the NVME firmware is updated to the
  latest version.

# Reporting Issues

Issues found while using this release that are not present in upstream Linux may
be reported using Github Issues at:

- https://github.com/oracle/linux-uek/issues

If you have kernel patches, please contribute to upstream Linux first! Patches
accepted by upstream will be part of the next UEK-next build a few weeks after
that kernel is released.
